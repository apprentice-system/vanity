Vanity import definitions for apprentice.systems Go modules

## Purpose

To hold the vanity import definitions for apprentice.systems Go modules. Each folder contains  static HTML files with the required `go-import` and optional `go-source` meta tags so that `go get` and module-aware tools route requests to the correct VCS locations.
